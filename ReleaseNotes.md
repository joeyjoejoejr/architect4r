# Release Notes

## v0.3

This release marks the first public release. So I wont get into length 
with its changes and new features. Let's just say it allows you to create
nodes and relationships between nodes. That's it!

## v0.2

Another internal release which was not ready for development or production.
_Please do not use it or try working with it!_ ;)

## v0.1

Some initial internal release which was very buggy and limited on the features.
