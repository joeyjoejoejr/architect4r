# Release Notes

## v0.3.2

* Support for carrierwave file upload mechanism

## v0.3.1

  In order to use neo4j in combination with other databases, we provide a 
  small extension which allows you to keep a node in sync with another's 
  datastore record.

## v0.3

This release marks the first public release. So I wont get into length 
with its changes and new features. Let's just say it allows you to create
nodes and relationships between nodes. That's it!

* Nodes (create, update, destroy)
* Relationships (create, update, destroy)
* Querying neo4j by using cypher query language
* Callbacks and validations for nodes and relationships

## v0.2

Another internal release which was not ready for development or production.
_Please do not use it or try working with it!_ ;)

## v0.1

Some initial internal release which was very buggy and limited on the features.
