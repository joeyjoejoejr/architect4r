# Architect4r

Architect4r is intended as an easy ruby wrapper for the neo4j graph db 
REST API. There are other solutions such as neo4j.rb if you are working 
in a java environment or neography which provides another working wrapper 
for the REST API. Both solutions are far more feature complete and allow 
you to do pretty advanced queries on the graph.

Architect4r is trying to go another route. Instead of using the native 
graph traversal engine it requires you to write your queries in recently 
implemented cypher query language. The language is well documented at the 
official neo4j documentation (http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/milestone/). 
Just that you know what you are dealing withâ€¦ a little example:

    start s=node(1) match s-[:friends]-d return d order by d.name skip 0 limit 20

But please read the docs for more info.

Requirements
------------
